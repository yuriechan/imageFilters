# Image Filters
A tool to add filters to static images.<br>
[Visit here for a clip of video to see the working application](https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/public/projects/1187.html), on a public page hosted by Stanford University.

## Motivation 
I wanted to learn a new programming language during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.<br>
This is part of the final project of an online course, `Code in Place`, offered by Stanford University. <br>

* Code in Place, offered online by Stanford University April-May 2020
  * A 5-week introductory online Python programming course based on material from the first half of Stanfordâ€™s introductory programming course, CS106A.
  * Offered by Stanford during COVID-19 pandemic, with 10,000 global students and 900 volunteer teachers participating from around the world.


## Learning Experience 
* Using a UI framework, Tkinter was more difficult than learning Python
* It was a good project to apply my understanding in OOP


## Development 

### Setting up
* Use git clone to clone this repository. Alternatively, download the source code.
* Make sure you have `python3` and `Numpy` installed.

### Development and testing
* Execute:
  * `python3 filters.py` to run the application.
